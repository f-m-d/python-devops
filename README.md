## Create a project scaffold
Explain each component of the project are
* Create development environment that is cloud-based:

### Colab Notebook
* This is an example of how to use colab [colab](https://github.com/f-m-d/python-devops/blob/main/getting_started_python.ipynb)

### Github Codespaces
Building out a Python project scaffold:
* Create a MakeFile
    * touch Makefile   
* requirements.txt for Python
    * touch requirements.txt
* Test library to create (E.G. test_library.py)
* Path where CLI and Containerized tool reference the same code: python_library
* A Dockerfile
* Command-Line Tool
* Microservice


1. Create a Python Virtual Environment 


#### Getting started on Github Codespaces
Essentialy is a space where you can edit and manage your repo online, it's like a dev box online

Steps:
* Go to your repo, "Code" --> "Codespaces" --> "Create a codespace" 
* If asked, on bottom right, install Python add-ons (Python and Pylance)


### AWS CloudShell

### AWS Cloud9

## Command-lines tools



## Microservices


## Containerzed Continuos Delivery


# Colab Notebook 
https://colab.research.google.com/

This is the colab link: [colab file](https://github.com/f-m-d/python-devops/blob/main/getting_started_python.ipynb)
* Create a new notebook (you can save a Copy on Github)
* You can change runtime (CPU,TPU TensorFlow Processing Units, GPU etc.)
* Use the Colab Notebooks in order to update and show the steps to be done
